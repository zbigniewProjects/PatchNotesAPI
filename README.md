Wep api for posting&editing&retrieving patch notes for software projects with custom middleware api key authentication. I use it to track development of my game & my website for that game fetches patch notes from this simple crud API 

My game's website's frontend uses this api to render patch notes of the game: https://destructors.net/updates
